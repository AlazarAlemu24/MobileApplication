“The app”
•	Project description
•	As we all know not a lot of people know about car parts, where to go for a specific car problem, what is wrong with their car …. the list goes on. Mostly our sisters are getting ripped off if they do not consult to someone that they know. Let’s say a family is on a road trip and their car breaks down, if they do not know the area and do not know what’s wrong with the car, they will most likely be forced to spend whatever it costs for them to get back on the road. My app “ “ , which I haven’t come up with a name for it, will promotes the customers to fill in a simple user friendly form with pictures and videos then predicts the issue and locate the nearest car shop with a good review for that specific issue. Also, estimates how much it should cost and make the family aware of what to expect. Innovation plays an important role here; this app might be the first at connecting customers with a live mechanic through a chat or a call to guide in the troubleshooting process and lead them to a recommended car shop. This innovation might also improve a process that is out there with more specific solutions in a user-friendly design. This app will make people aware of their own car details and what they should know before going to a car shop so that they can avoid being ripped off. Also, this will educate customers about cars and can help them in the future.
